# About
I together with 5 like-minded students, complete this Class website, because the project before we browse the same type of site design, it is out of date. 

So we challenge ourselves to design a more close to the mainstream design the class website, used to contact the students that will be lost, and to strengthen the expertise we have learned. It will be updated as we continue to develop our professional knowledge. 

NOTE: This is just a static template.

## Framework
Material design theme for Bootstrap, it is a Bootstrap V3 compatible theme.

## Plugins
We use a lot of plugins, including date selection, file selection, etc. They are all based on bootstrap.
